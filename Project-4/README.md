## Program Descriptions

### CPU iota (iota.cpp)
The CPU version of "iota" fills a vector so that each element contains its index plus a starting value. This is implemented as a simple loop running on the CPU.

### CUDA iota (iota.cu)
The CUDA version launches a kernel where each GPU thread computes one element of the vector. Each thread writes `startValue + index` into the output array.

### CPU Julia (julia.cpp)
The CPU Julia program generates a Julia (Mandelbrot) set image by iterating over each pixel, mapping it to a complex number, iterating the Julia equation, and assigning a color based on the number of iterations.

### CUDA Julia (julia.cu)
The CUDA Julia program assigns one pixel to each GPU thread. Each thread performs the same computation as the CPU version but in parallel, writing the resulting color into the output image buffer.

## iota Results Discussion

The results were expected. The CUDA version of iota was slower than the CPU version because each element only does a very small amount of work. The time spent launching the CUDA kernel and copying data to and from the GPU takes longer than the actual computation. Since iota does very little work per element, the GPU cannot take advantage of its parallel processing, which makes CUDA a poor choice for this problem.
